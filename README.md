# TEST

This is a repository created as a way for me to learn about and explore Git and GitHub.

Not much to see here (:

## REMINDERS ON WORKFLOW

use cd to access directories

### ON CLI
- Edit Code
- use "git add file-name | .
- git commit -m "text" -m "text"
- git push origin main | master 
- Pull request on GitHub if needed

#### BRANCH ONE TEST
Just a demo
