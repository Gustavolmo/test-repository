# TEST

This is a repository created as a way for me to learn about and explore Git and GitHub.

Not much to see here (:

## USEFUL STUFF
- use cd to access directories
- use git status for checking progress
- use git log to see commit history
- git remote add origin (link SSH)
- git push origin main (or other branch) | git push (link SSH)

### COMMITING
- Edit Code & Save
- git add file-name | .
- git commit -m "text" -m "text"
- git push origin main | master 
- Pull request on GitHub if needed

### BRANCHING
- (check the branch) git branch
- (switch | -b new branches) git checkout -b new-branch-name
- (check code diff) git diff

### REVERSING ACTIONS
- git reset to undo git add
- git reset HEAD to undo commit (add ~ and a number after HEAD to point at older commits)
